# Using Telnet
Telnet is an application layer protocal used on the internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.
User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
